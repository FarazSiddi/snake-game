This is my first project in JavaScript. It is a Snake Game clone with some extra features added to make it more enjoyable

As of now, there are only two themes (light and dark) and three game modes (normal, fast, and progressive)

The three game work as follows:

- Normal: Default snake speed. The game runs normally
- Fast: The snake moves twice as fast compared to the default game mode
- Progressive: The snake moves 5% faster than the default speed every time you get a point
